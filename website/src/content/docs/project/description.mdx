description: Spotify Wrapped project description
---

This project is a clone of Spotify Wrapped, a feature that Spotify releases at the end of each year. The app generates a list of the user's top 5 songs, artists, and genres based on their listening habits. The app also provides recommendations for songs and artists based on the user's music tastes. Additionally, the app contains two music-related games that the user can play.

This project implements features based on user stories and requirements provided by the client.

## Features

### Base user stories

:::note[User story 1 | Wrapped Generation]

As a user, I want to be able to view a presentation of the different aspects of my personal Spotify music listening tastes displayed in colorful and fun ways.

:::

:::note[User story 2 | Viewing Previous Wraps and Login]

As a user, I want to be able to create an account and log into to the app so I can view my past Spotify Wrapped summaries.

:::

To implement this feature, we used Firebase Auth and Firestore to store user data and wrapped information.

<Steps>

1. User login: The app allows users to sign up and log in to their Spotify Wrapped account.

2. Then, the user must login to their Spotify account to access their music data.

</Steps>

### Customizable user stories

The app allows users to sign up and log in to their Spotify Wrapped account. Then, the user must login to their Spotify account to access their music data.

- Wrapped Generation: The app is capable of generating a list similar to Spotify Wrapped with the users top 5 songs, artists, and genres. Users can choose to generate a wrapped based upon a specific timeframe.

- Viewing Previous Wraps: Users can view wraps that they have previously generated within the app.

- Recommendations: The app can provide the user with artist and song recommendations based upon their music tastes.

- Games: The app contains two music related games the user can play.


### Technical features

The app is built for Android devices, using Java. We are using Spotify API to access the user's music data. The app is connected to a Firebase database to store user data and wrapped information.

For this website, we are using Astro Starlight, a static site generator that allows us to create a website using markdown files.

As for the backend, we are using Firebase Auth and Firestore to store user data and wrapped information. We have also implemented a CI/CD pipeline that verifies that the code is built and formatted correctly. Branches that fail CI/CD runs are not allowed to merge into the main on Github.

## Design process

### Scrum Methodology

Our team used SCRUM in our approach to product management beginning with the creation of a comprehensive plan outlining the user stories we aimed to accomplish. These user stories served as the backbone of our development efforts and ensured that we remained focused and were able to achieve established goals.

To maintain transparency and alignment with our client's (TA) expectations, we followed weekly sprints. At the start of each sprint, we performed Sprint planning, in which we held a meeting to discuss what would be accomplished. At the end of a sprint, a review was held in which we would present completed work to the client for feedback. From this, we were able to adjust needs that may have been missed and ensure the product met the client's expectations.

In terms of task management and coordination within our team, we leveraged GitHub's project management features. We were able to streamline our workflow by tracking tasks within GitHub. This approach facilitated effective collaboration and allowed for us to meet deadlines.

Trello was also used for the product backlog. For each sprint, a new Trello board was created with to-do, in progress, review, and done columns to track the status of different tasks.

Additionally, we utilized WhatsApp as a supplementary communication channel for more immediate discussions. This platform allowed us to quickly address urgent matters and seek clarification on certain tasks.

Overall, our approach to project management encompassed planning, regular client engagement, transparent task management through GitHub and Trello and efficient communication via WhatsApp. These practices enabled us to navigate the complexities of the development process effectively, and to deliver a final product that met the client's expectations.

### Design

The app follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.

This pattern was beneficial for multiple reasons:

<Steps>

1. This pattern allowed for the application to broken into components for modular development.

2. Components could be reused across the application, leading to faster development and fewer bugs.

3. Since the view is separated from the model and controller, it was possible to have multiple views for the same data.
