description: Spotify Wrapped project description
---

This project is a clone of Spotify Wrapped, a feature that Spotify releases at the end of each year. The app generates a list of the user's top 5 songs, artists, and genres based on their listening habits. The app also provides recommendations for songs and artists based on the user's music tastes. Additionally, the app contains two music-related games that the user can play.

## Features

This project implements features based on user stories and requirements provided by the client.

### User stories

:::note[User story 1 | Wrapped Generation]

As a user, I want to be able to view a presentation of the different aspects of my personal Spotify music listening tastes displayed in colorful and fun ways.

:::

For the most basic functionality of the Wrapped which might be to get a Wrapped about the most listened songs, artists and genres of the last year we used API calls from the Spotify API which let us get the top 5 most listened songs, artists or genres of the last year. We had to parse the data received after calling this method and getting the songs, artists and genres needed. Afterwards we just created a fun Wrapped to display all of them in a interactive and colourful way following always the original colours that are characteristic from Spotify.

:::note[User story 6 | Games]

We've made two games for the Wrapped app. The first one of the games is about being able to guess which playlist the song is from and the second one is about completing the name of a song. For the first one of the games we ask the Spotify API to give us the information from the different playlists that the user has. Afterwards we get randomly the playlist where the song will be picked to guess. Finally we will get the other two playlists randomly by checking these new playlists don't have the song selected to evade conflicts.

For the second game we will just randomly get one song from all their playlists following the process explained before and parse the name song to prepare the letters that will be hidden on it.

:::note[User story 7 | Artist recommendations]

As a user, I would like new artists recommended to me based on my music tastes.

:::

Our application is capable of suggesting new artists based on the user's and their friends' music tastes. The idea in mind is to create a more connected and discovery-oriented user experience. We achieve this by including two different buttons that the user can interact with to generate recommended songs or recommended artists.

For this we used a Spotify API function that is capable of recommending songs/artists based on a list of songs/artists provided as an argument when calling the method. Getting the songs or artists is simple because we just used methods from the API which provides us the five most listened songs/artists and afterwards we just needed to parse and call the function mentioned before to get recommendations based on these artists or songs.

:::note[User story 8 | Different time spans]
As a user, I would like to control the timespan of the generated Wrapped summary
:::

To be able to produce seasonally themed Spotify Wrapped we have used the characteristic from Spotify API where you can select a timestamp from the most listened song, artists and music genres. People would be able to select from short-term, medium-term and long-term when asking for a Spotify Wrapped and this would give them a Wrapped about their most listened songs, artists and music genres from the last month (short-term), the sixth last months (medium-term) or the last year (long-term).

:::note[User story 10 | CI/CD pipeline]

As a developer, I would like a CI/CD pipeline to test my code to verify that it builds and is formatted correctly.

:::

We've established a CI/CD pipeline on GitHub using GitHub Actions. This pipeline automates code compilation and runs unit tests, ensuring automatic quality checks with each commit. By integrating unit testing into our workflow, we catch bugs early and maintain code reliability. This streamlined process accelerates feedback loops and enables faster, more confident delivery of high-quality software.

Also, we incorporated automatic code formatting according to Google's Java formatting rules. The Github Action is capable of modifying the source code to make it adhere to the rules and making a commit to the repo with the changes.

:::note[User story 13 | PRs and issue templates]

As a developer, I would like to be able to use pre-made templates for PRs and issues in GitHub.

:::

Through the implementation of our application, we introduced Github Templates to improve the development process. These templates provide a standardised framework for contributions, making them easier to review and ensuring alignment with established guidelines. By using these templates, we've fostered consistency and reliability across our application and development environment.


:::note[User story 12 and base user story 2 | Create account]

User story 12: As a user, I would like to be able to sign into my account from any device (Firebase cloud storage instead of SQLite)

Base #2: As a user, I want to be able to create an account and log into to the app so I can view my past Spotify Wrapped summaries.

### User login

In this project, we implemented 

<Card>

</Card>

The app allows users to sign up and log in to their Spotify Wrapped account. Then, the user must login to their Spotify account to access their music data.

- Wrapped Generation: The app is capable of generating a list similar to Spotify Wrapped with the users top 5 songs, artists, and genres. Users can choose to generate a wrapped based upon a specific timeframe.

- Viewing Previous Wraps: Users can view wraps that they have previously generated within the app.

- Recommendations: The app can provide the user with artist and song recommendations based upon their music tastes.

- Games: The app contains two music related games the user can play.


### Technical features

The app is built for Android devices, using Java. We are using Spotify API to access the user's music data. The app is connected to a Firebase database to store user data and wrapped information.

For this website, we are using Astro Starlight, a static site generator that allows us to create a website using markdown files.

{/* <Icon name="seti:firebase" color="goldenrod" /> */}

As for the backend, we are using Firebase Auth and Firestore to store user data and wrapped information. We have also implemented a CI/CD pipeline that verifies that the code is built and formatted correctly. Branches that fail CI/CD runs are not allowed to merge into the main on Github.

- Implemented Firebase Auth and Firestore to store user data and wrapped information.

## Design process

### Scrum Methodology

Our team used SCRUM in our approach to product management beginning with the creation of a comprehensive plan outlining the user stories we aimed to accomplish. These user stories served as the backbone of our development efforts and ensured that we remained focused and were able to achieve established goals.

To maintain transparency and alignment with our client's (TA) expectations, we followed weekly sprints. At the start of each sprint, we performed Sprint planning, in which we held a meeting to discuss what would be accomplished. At the end of a sprint, a review was held in which we would present completed work to the client for feedback. From this, we were able to adjust needs that may have been missed and ensure the product met the client's expectations.

In terms of task management and coordination within our team, we leveraged GitHub's project management features. We were able to streamline our workflow by tracking tasks within GitHub. This approach facilitated effective collaboration and allowed for us to meet deadlines.

Trello was also used for the product backlog. For each sprint, a new Trello board was created with to-do, in progress, review, and done columns to track the status of different tasks.

Additionally, we utilized WhatsApp as a supplementary communication channel for more immediate discussions. This platform allowed us to quickly address urgent matters and seek clarification on certain tasks.

Overall, our approach to project management encompassed planning, regular client engagement, transparent task management through GitHub and Trello and efficient communication via WhatsApp. These practices enabled us to navigate the complexities of the development process effectively, and to deliver a final product that met the client's expectations.

### Design

The app follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.

This pattern was beneficial for multiple reasons:

<Steps>

1. This pattern allowed for the application to broken into components for modular development.

2. Components could be reused across the application, leading to faster development and fewer bugs.

3. Since the view is separated from the model and controller, it was possible to have multiple views for the same data.

</Steps>
